# Safari Zone Strategy

## Overview

The Safari Zone is a special area in Fuchsia City where you can catch rare Pokémon. It has unique mechanics: you have 500 steps and can't use your own Pokémon to battle.

**Location:** Fuchsia City (north side)  
**Cost:** $500 per entry  
**Steps:** 500 maximum  
**Special:** Can't use own Pokémon, can't weaken wild Pokémon

---

## Safari Zone Mechanics

### How It Works

1. **Pay $500** to enter
2. **Receive 30 Safari Balls** (special Poké Balls, only work in Safari Zone)
3. **500 step limit** - Game ends when you run out of steps
4. **Can't use your Pokémon** - No battles, only catching

### Battle Options

When you encounter a wild Pokémon, you have 4 options:

1. **Ball** - Throw Safari Ball (uses 1 ball)
2. **Bait** - Throw bait (makes Pokémon less likely to flee, but harder to catch)
3. **Rock** - Throw rock (makes Pokémon easier to catch, but more likely to flee)
4. **Run** - Flee from battle

### Bait vs Rock Strategy

**Bait:**
- ✅ Pokémon less likely to flee
- ❌ Pokémon harder to catch
- **Use for:** Rare Pokémon that flee often (Chansey, Tauros, Kangaskhan)

**Rock:**
- ✅ Pokémon easier to catch
- ❌ Pokémon more likely to flee
- **Use for:** Common Pokémon, or when you have many Safari Balls left

**Optimal Strategy:**
- Throw 1-2 Rocks first (increase catch rate)
- Then throw Balls
- If Pokémon doesn't flee after 2-3 balls, throw Bait
- Then throw more Balls

## Catching Strategy by Pokémon

### Chansey (4% rate, flees often)
```
Strategy: BAIT HEAVY
1. Encounter Chansey
2. Throw Bait (2-3 times)
3. Throw Ball
4. Repeat Bait + Ball until caught
5. DO NOT throw Rock (will flee!)
```
**Why:** Chansey has very high HP but flees easily. Bait keeps it around.

### Tauros / Kangaskhan (5% rate, moderate flee)
```
Strategy: BALANCED
1. Encounter Tauros/Kangaskhan
2. Throw Rock (1 time)
3. Throw Ball (2-3 times)
4. If still not caught, throw Bait (1 time)
5. Throw Ball until caught
```
**Why:** Moderate catch rate, moderate flee rate. Balance is key.

### Scyther / Pinsir (4-5% rate, low flee)
```
Strategy: ROCK HEAVY
1. Encounter Scyther/Pinsir
2. Throw Rock (2 times)
3. Throw Ball until caught
```
**Why:** Don't flee often, so Rock is safe. Increases catch rate.

### Exeggcute (5% rate, low flee)
```
Strategy: ROCK HEAVY
1. Encounter Exeggcute
2. Throw Rock (1-2 times)
3. Throw Ball until caught
```
**Why:** Doesn't flee often, Rock is safe.

## Bot Strategy

### Priority List
1. **HM03 (Surf)** - MUST GET! Required for progression
2. **Gold Teeth** - MUST GET! Required for HM04 (Strength)
3. **Chansey** - Very rare, high priority
4. **Scyther (Red) / Pinsir (Blue)** - Version exclusive
5. **Tauros** - Rare, strong
6. **Kangaskhan** - Rare, strong
7. **Exeggcute** - Uncommon, useful

### Multi-Run Strategy

**Run 1: Get HMs**
- Go straight to Secret House
- Get Surf and Gold Teeth
- Catch whatever you encounter on the way
- Exit

**Run 2-5: Catch Rare Pokémon**
- Focus on Area 3 (Tauros, Kangaskhan, Scyther/Pinsir)
- Then Area 2 (Chansey, Exeggcute)
- Use optimal catching strategies
- Exit when out of balls or steps

**Expected Runs:** 3-5 runs to catch all rare Pokémon  
**Total Cost:** $1500-2500

### Step Management

**500 steps = precious!**

- Don't waste steps in Entrance Area
- Go straight to Area 3
- Walk efficiently (no backtracking)
- Use Repel if you want to avoid common Pokémon (but can't use items in Safari Zone!)

**Actually, you CAN'T use Repel in Safari Zone!** So just run from common Pokémon.

## Troubleshooting

### "I ran out of steps before getting Surf!"
- Reset and try again
- Go STRAIGHT to Secret House (Area 3)
- Don't waste steps catching common Pokémon

### "I ran out of Safari Balls!"
- You get 30 balls per run
- Don't waste balls on common Pokémon
- Run from Nidoran, Paras, Venonat, Doduo

### "I can't find Chansey!"
- 4% encounter rate = very rare
- Walk around Area 2 for 10+ minutes
- May take multiple runs

### "Chansey keeps fleeing!"
- Use Bait strategy (2-3 Baits, then Ball)
- DO NOT throw Rock at Chansey!
- Be patient, may take 10+ balls

### "I can't find Tauros/Kangaskhan!"
- 5% encounter rate = rare
- Walk around Area 3
- May take 20-30 encounters

## Bot Implementation Notes

### Pathfinding
```python
def safari_zone_optimal_path():
    # Run 1: Get HMs
    enter_safari_zone()
    navigate_to_area_3()
    enter_secret_house()
    collect_item("HM03_Surf")
    collect_item("Gold_Teeth")
    exit_secret_house()
    
    # Catch rare Pokemon in Area 3
    catch_pokemon_in_area(area=3, targets=["Tauros", "Kangaskhan", "Scyther", "Pinsir"])
    
    # Move to Area 2
    navigate_to_area_2()
    catch_pokemon_in_area(area=2, targets=["Chansey", "Exeggcute"])
    
    # Exit when low on resources
    if safari_balls < 5 or steps < 50:
        exit_safari_zone()
```

### Catching Logic
```python
def catch_safari_pokemon(pokemon_name):
    if pokemon_name == "Chansey":
        # Bait heavy strategy
        throw_bait(times=2)
        throw_ball()
        while not caught and not fled:
            throw_bait()
            throw_ball()
    
    elif pokemon_name in ["Tauros", "Kangaskhan"]:
        # Balanced strategy
        throw_rock(times=1)
        throw_ball(times=2)
        if not caught:
            throw_bait(times=1)
            throw_ball()
    
    elif pokemon_name in ["Scyther", "Pinsir", "Exeggcute"]:
        # Rock heavy strategy
        throw_rock(times=2)
        while not caught and not fled:
            throw_ball()
    
    else:
        # Common Pokemon - just throw ball or run
        if safari_balls > 20:
            throw_ball()
        else:
            run()
```

### Resource Management
```python
def should_continue_safari():
    if safari_balls < 3:
        return False  # Exit, not enough balls
    if steps < 30:
        return False  # Exit, not enough steps
    if all_targets_caught():
        return False  # Exit, mission complete
    return True
```
