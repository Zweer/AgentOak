### Fossil Choice: Helix vs Dome

**CRITICAL DECISION - Can only choose ONE per save file!**

**Helix Fossil → Omanyte (#138) → Omastar (#139)**
- Type: Rock/Water
- Stats: High Defense, High Special
- Moves: Water Gun, Withdraw, Horn Attack, Leer
- Evolution: Lv40 → Omastar

**Dome Fossil → Kabuto (#140) → Kabutops (#141)**
- Type: Rock/Water
- Stats: High Attack, High Defense
- Moves: Scratch, Harden, Absorb
- Evolution: Lv40 → Kabutops

### Which Fossil to Choose?

**For Pokédex Completion (Multi-Instance Bot):**

**Recommendation:**
- **Blue #1 (Primary):** Helix Fossil (Omanyte)
- **Red #1 (Primary):** Dome Fossil (Kabuto)
- **Secondary instances:** Opposite fossil
- **Trade between instances** to complete Pokédex

**Why this distribution:**
- Ensures both fossil lines are obtained
- Primaries get different fossils (diversity)
- Can trade later to register both

**If only ONE instance:**
- **Choose Helix (Omanyte)** - Slightly better stats, more useful moveset
- Trade with another player/bot for Kabuto later

**Fossil Revival:**
- Both fossils are revived at Cinnabar Island (much later in game)
- Take fossil to Pokémon Lab on Cinnabar
- Scientist revives it into Lv5 Pokémon
- Can't use until late game, but choice is permanent NOW

### Mt. Moon Navigation

**Optimal Path:**
1. Enter Mt. Moon from Route 3
2. 1F: Go north, collect Potion
3. 1F: Check rock for **Hidden Moon Stone** (critical!)
4. 1F: Go down ladder to B1F
5. B1F: Battle trainers, collect Rare Candy and Escape Rope
6. B1F: Go down ladder to B2F
7. B2F: Navigate to Super Nerd
8. B2F: Defeat Super Nerd
9. B2F: **Choose fossil** (Helix or Dome)
10. B2F: Collect TM01 (Mega Punch)
11. B2F: Exit north to Route 4

**Time in Mt. Moon:** ~20-30 minutes

**Level After Mt. Moon:** Should be Lv15-17

Victory in ~3-4 turns
```

```
