# Master Plan: 151 Pokémon Completion

## Overview

This is the complete strategy for catching all 151 Pokémon in **Pokémon Blue** using Red and Yellow as support games. The plan coordinates three games to:
- **Blue (Primary):** Complete 151/151 Pokédex
- **Red (Support):** Provide version exclusives and trade evolutions
- **Yellow (Support):** Provide missing starters (Charmander, Squirtle)

**Goal:** Blue reaches 151/151. Red and Yellow are minimal support only.

**Estimated Time:** 
- Blue: ~25-30 hours (full completion)
- Red: ~8-10 hours (support only)
- Yellow: ~3-4 hours (starter gifts only)
- **Total: ~38 hours**

---

## Philosophy

### Division of Labor
- **Blue (Primary):** Main progression, catches all Pokémon, reaches 151/151
- **Red (Support):** Provides Red exclusives, trade evolutions, alternative one-time Pokémon
- **Yellow (Support):** Provides missing starters (Charmander, Squirtle)

### Key Decisions

| Decision | Blue | Red | Yellow | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----|--------|-----------|
| **Starter** | Bulbasaur | Squirtle | Pikachu (forced) | Blue gets Bulbasaur, others from Yellow |
| **Fossil** | Helix (Omanyte) | Dome (Kabuto) | N/A | One per version |
| **Hitmon** | Hitmonlee | Hitmonchan | N/A | One per version |
| **Eevee Evolution** | Vaporeon + Flareon | Jolteon | N/A | Blue gets 2, Red provides 3rd |

### Why This Strategy?
- **No redundant work:** Red and Yellow do minimum required
- **Faster:** Yellow gifts starters faster than catching/evolving
- **Clean:** Each game has clear purpose
- **Efficient:** ~38 hours total vs ~60 hours if all games complete

## Time Estimates

### Blue (Primary)
- **Intro to Badge 3:** 4-5 hours
- **Badge 4-6:** 8-10 hours
- **Badge 7-8 + Elite Four:** 8-10 hours
- **Post-game:** 4-6 hours
- **Total:** ~25-30 hours

### Red (Support)
- **Intro to Badge 5:** 8-10 hours
- **Catching exclusives:** Included above
- **Total:** ~8-10 hours

### Yellow (Support)
- **Intro to Vermilion:** 3-4 hours
- **Total:** ~3-4 hours

### Trading
- **Sync 1 (Yellow):** 10 minutes
- **Sync 2 (Red):** 30 minutes
- **Sync 3 (Trade evolutions):** 20 minutes
- **Total:** ~1 hour

### Grand Total
**~38 hours** for Blue to reach 151/151 (with Red and Yellow support)

**Note:** Games can run in parallel, so wall-clock time may be less.

---

## Notes

### Optimization Opportunities
- Run all games at 2-4x speed when not trading
- Use item duplication for Master Balls (easier legendary catches)
- Catch evolved forms in wild when possible (saves leveling time)
- Use Rare Candies from duplication for faster evolutions
- Red can stop immediately after Sync 2 if trade evolutions done early

### Risk Mitigation
- Save before every legendary encounter
- Save before Mew glitch execution
- Keep backup save states at each sync point
- Test link cable connection early (Sync 1 with Yellow)
- Don't defeat required trainers for Mew glitch

### Yellow-Specific Notes
- Pikachu MUST stay in party for starter gifts
- Keep Pikachu happiness high (don't let faint, use potions)
- Charmander gift requires defeating trainers on Route 24
- Squirtle gift is automatic in Vermilion (talk to Officer Jenny)

### Red-Specific Notes
- Focus ONLY on Red exclusives, ignore everything else
- Don't waste time catching Blue exclusives
- Can use Rare Candy duplication to speed up evolutions
- Doesn't need to catch legendaries or complete Pokédex

### Future Enhancements
- Add 2nd Yellow run for 3rd Eevee evolution (if needed)
- Automate optimal catching routes
- LLM decision-making for complex situations
- Dashboard with live Pokédex tracking for all 3 games
