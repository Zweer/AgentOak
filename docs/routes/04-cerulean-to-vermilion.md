        check(can)
        if switch_found:
            first_switch = can
            break
    
    # Find second switch (adjacent to first)
    adjacent_cans = get_adjacent(first_switch)
    for can in adjacent_cans:
        check(can)
        if switch_found:
            return True  # Puzzle solved
    
    # If failed, reset and try again
    return solve_trash_can_puzzle()

def get_adjacent(can):
    # Returns list of adjacent cans (up, down, left, right)

```

### Error Handling
