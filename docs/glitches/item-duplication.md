# Item Duplication Glitch (MissingNo Glitch)

## Overview

The Item Duplication glitch, commonly known as the MissingNo glitch or Old Man glitch, allows you to duplicate items in Pokémon Red and Blue. This is achieved by encountering the glitch Pokémon "MissingNo" which multiplies your 6th item slot by 128.

**Compatibility:**
- ✅ Pokémon Red
- ✅ Pokémon Blue
- ❌ Pokémon Yellow (DOES NOT WORK!)

**Difficulty:** Easy  
**Risk:** Medium (can corrupt Hall of Fame, but save file is safe)  
**Result:** 6th item slot increased by 128 (max 255)

---

## ⚠️ WARNING

**Catching MissingNo:**
- ❌ **DO NOT CATCH MISSINGNO!**
- Catching it will corrupt your Hall of Fame data
- Your save file will still work, but Hall of Fame will be glitched
- You only need to **encounter** it, not catch it

**Safe Actions:**
- ✅ Encounter MissingNo (item duplication happens)
- ✅ Run away from MissingNo
- ✅ Faint MissingNo (if you want)
- ❌ DO NOT catch MissingNo

   - Make sure you have at least 1 of the item

2. **Go to Viridian City**
   - Fly or walk to Viridian City

3. **Talk to Old Man**
   - Location: North side of Viridian City (near Route 2)
   - Old man who teaches you how to catch Pokémon
   - He asks: "Are you in a hurry?"
   - Answer: **NO**

4. **Watch catching tutorial**
   - Old man demonstrates catching a Weedle
   - Watch the entire tutorial
   - **This temporarily changes your name in game memory**

5. **Tutorial ends**

   - You regain control

### Phase 2: Trigger Glitch (Cinnabar Island)

6. **Fly to Cinnabar Island**
   - Open menu
   - Use Fly
   - Select Cinnabar Island

7. **Go to east coast**
   - Walk to the right (east) side of Cinnabar Island
   - Find the coast where you can Surf

8. **Surf on the coast**
   - Use Surf on the water
   - Surf **up and down** along the right edge of the island
   - Stay on the tiles directly adjacent to the coast
   - **Do NOT go too far out into the ocean**

9. **Encounter MissingNo or 'M**
   - After a few seconds of surfing, you'll encounter:
     - MissingNo (glitch Pokémon, looks like scrambled pixels)
     - OR 'M (another glitch Pokémon)

### Phase 3: Item Duplication

    - If you had 1 Rare Candy, now you have 129
    - Maximum is 255 (game limit)

   - Get from Silph Co. after defeating Giovanni
   - Only 1 in game normally
   - Duplicate to 255 for easy legendary catches

2. **Rare Candy** - Instantly levels up Pokémon
   - Found in various locations
   - Duplicate to 255 for instant level 100 Pokémon

3. **Nugget** - Sells for $5000
   - Found in various locations
   - Duplicate to 255 = $1,275,000 when sold!

4. **PP Up** - Increases PP of moves
   - Rare item
   - Useful for competitive Pokémon

5. **Max Revive** - Fully revives fainted Pokémon
   - Expensive to buy
   - Very useful for Elite Four

## Troubleshooting

### "I don't encounter MissingNo, only normal Pokémon"
- Make sure you watched Old Man's tutorial
- Make sure you're surfing on the **right (east) coast** of Cinnabar
- Try surfing up and down more
- Encounters are based on your player name

### "I encountered high-level Pokémon (Lv100+) instead"
- This is normal! It's part of the glitch
- Run away or catch them (safe to catch)
- Item duplication still works
- Try surfing more to find MissingNo

### "My 6th item didn't increase"
- Make sure item was in **6th slot** (not 1st, 2nd, etc.)
- Check if you had at least 1 of the item
- Try the glitch again

### "I accidentally caught MissingNo!"
- Your save file is still safe
- Hall of Fame is corrupted (glitched entries)
- Game still works normally
- You can still complete Pokédex
- Just don't look at Hall of Fame (it's glitched)

### "Game froze or crashed"
- Reset game
- Your save file is safe (glitch doesn't corrupt saves)
- Try again, but don't catch MissingNo

## Technical Explanation

**Why does this work?**

1. Old Man's tutorial temporarily stores your player name in a different memory location
2. This memory location is normally used for wild Pokémon encounter data
3. When you Surf on Cinnabar coast, game reads this memory as encounter data
4. Your player name characters are interpreted as Pokémon species
5. This causes MissingNo and other glitch Pokémon to appear
6. MissingNo has a special property: when encountered, it multiplies 6th item by 128
7. This is a programming oversight in how MissingNo's data is structured

**Is this safe?**
- Save file: ✅ Safe (won't corrupt)
- Hall of Fame: ❌ Will be corrupted if you catch MissingNo
- Pokédex: ✅ Safe (won't affect)
- Game progress: ✅ Safe (won't affect)

## Advanced: Encounter Different Pokémon

The Pokémon you encounter depend on your player name!

**Common encounters with default names:**

**Name "RED":**
- MissingNo (Lv80, Lv128, Lv132)
- Golduck (Lv128)
- Snorlax (Lv128)

**Name "ASH":**
- MissingNo (Lv80)
- Mewtwo (Lv128) - Can catch!
- Mew (Lv7) - Can catch!

**Name "BLUE":**
- MissingNo (Lv80, Lv132)
- Electrode (Lv132)

**Custom names:**
- Different letters = different Pokémon
- Can encounter any Pokémon in game
- Can encounter glitch Pokémon

## Bot Implementation Notes

### Safety Checks:
```python
def can_do_missingno_glitch():
    checks = {
        "game_is_red_or_blue": game_version in ["Red", "Blue"],
        "has_fly": player.has_hm(HM.FLY),
        "has_surf": player.has_hm(HM.SURF),
        "can_reach_viridian": player.can_reach("Viridian City"),
        "can_reach_cinnabar": player.can_reach("Cinnabar Island"),
        "old_man_tutorial_available": not tutorial_watched
    }
    return all(checks.values())
```

### Item Preparation:
```python
def prepare_item_for_duplication(item_name):
    # Move item to 6th slot
    bag = player.get_bag()
    item = bag.find_item(item_name)
    
    if item:
        bag.move_to_slot(item, slot=6)
        return True
    return False
```

### Glitch Execution:
```python
def execute_missingno_glitch(item_to_duplicate):
    # Phase 1: Old Man tutorial
    fly_to("Viridian City")
    talk_to_old_man()
    watch_tutorial()
    
    # Phase 2: Prepare item
    prepare_item_for_duplication(item_to_duplicate)
    
    # Phase 3: Cinnabar coast
    fly_to("Cinnabar Island")
    move_to_east_coast()
    use_surf()
    
    # Phase 4: Encounter and run
    while not missingno_encountered():
        surf_up_and_down()
    
    if encounter_is_missingno():
        run_from_battle()  # DO NOT CATCH!
    
    # Phase 5: Verify
    return verify_item_duplicated(item_to_duplicate)
```

### Verification:
```python
def verify_item_duplicated(item_name):
    bag = player.get_bag()
    item = bag.get_item_in_slot(6)
    
    if item.name == item_name:
        if item.quantity >= 128:
            return True
    return False
```
